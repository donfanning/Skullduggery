gregorah:~/src/android-sdk-linux_86/tools$ $ emulatorhelp-debug-tags
  the '-debug <tags>' option can be used to enable or disable debug
  messages from specific parts of the emulator. <tags> must be a list
  (separated by space/comma/column) of <component> names, which can be one of:

    init            emulator initialization
    console         control console
    modem           emulated GSM modem
    radio           emulated GSM AT Command channel
    keys            key bindings & presses
    slirp           internal router/firewall
    timezone        host timezone detection
    socket          network sockets
    proxy           network proxy support
    audio           audio sub-system
    audioin         audio input backend
    audioout        audio output backend
    surface         video surface support
    qemud           qemud multiplexer daemon
    gps             emulated GPS
    nand_limits     nand/flash read/write thresholding
    hw_control      emulated power/flashlight/led/vibrator
    avd_config      android virtual device configuration
    sensors         emulated sensors
    all             all components together


  each <component> can be prefixed with a single '-' to indicate the disabling
  of its debug messages. for example:

    -debug all,-socket,-keys

  enables all debug messages, except the ones related to network sockets
  and key bindings/presses
